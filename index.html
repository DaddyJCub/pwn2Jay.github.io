<h1>Pwn2Jay's Website</h1>
This is the place where I put my latest work and share my research behind it all.

For any questions, issues or any requests, dm or tweet me at <a href="https://twitter.com/Pwn2Jay">Pwn2Jay</a>

To support my ongoing iOS research and my tweaks/apps
 or just the time I spend on these things, my patreon is <a href="https://patreon.com/Pwn2Jay">Pwn2Jay</a>.
Any amount of pledge is appreciated
and helps me a lot as I do nothing but work/develop these days...
I'm constantly busy with School, Soccer, Spring Play, Show Choir, Drivers Ed., etc.
It'd just really be appreciated to cover all of my expenses.
i.e. Phone Bill, Show Choir, Drivers Ed., etc.
Thank you!
